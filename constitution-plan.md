### Legislative Branch

The Legislative Progression
- The People
- Second Class Committee - **local scope**
- First Class Committee
- District Congress - **district scope**
- Provincial Congress - **province scope**
- National Congress - **national scope**

**The Second Class Committee**
The People consists of all **legal citizens** of the nation. There is one Second Class Committee for each block of real estate. Each Committee is to have eleven members, elected by the People every six months. When the People wish for a new law, they will draft a Request (similar to a US Bill) and formally submit it to the Committee. The Committee will meet once a week to vote on these Requests. When the meeting has ended, any Requests that have been voted positive will become Law seven days later. If 1/3 or more of the People petition against a decision, the People may meet (attendance not required) and vote to repeal the Law. Requests may also be made to repeal a law, which requires a 7/11 majority.

**The First Class Committee**
At the end of a Second Class Committee meeting, they will vote 3 non-Committee members of their block to become a part of the next First Class Committee meeting. Their term lasts only one meeting. Citizens who do not wish to achieve local scope. Citizens without legal residence (homeless, living with parents, etc.) may also submit Requests to a First Class Committee. First Class Committees consist of the elected members of eleven blocks of real estate (11 blocks x 3 elected members = 33 total members). Then, three committees are formed randomly, each with eleven members. Each committee is randomly given an equal amount of Laws and Requests. The committee simply votes whether or not the Law/Request is to be sent to the District Congress. If not, the law still applies at Local Scope.

**District Congress**
District Congress members serve a two year term, and may serve only two years for every six. District Congress members must have served on a Second Class Committee for at least one term. Any sort of organized political party is illegal; people are individuals and they should not conform to one of two groups. District Congress may only pass Laws and view Requests that were first approved by a First Class Committee. District Congress members are to be voted for at Second Class Committee elections. There is to be one member per 1,500 people. In the case of a tie, the member who received the most votes during the election serves as the tie breaker.

**Provincial Congress**
Provincial Congress members serve a four year term, and may serve only four years for every six. Provincial Congress members may serve a maximum of three terms, however they may still serve on a District or National Congress once this limit is reached. Candidates for the Provincial Congress must have served at least one term on a District Congress. Provincial Congress is to have ten members for every district in the Province. In the case of a tie, the member who received the most votes during the election serves as the tie breaker. 

**National Congress**
National Congress members serve a four year term, and may serve only four years for every eight. National Congress members may serve a maximum of four terms, however they may still serve on a District or National Congress once this limit is reached. Candidates for the National Congress must have served at least one term on a District Congress. National Congress is to have three members for every Province.
